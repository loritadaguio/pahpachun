                            <p> I can get them to work fine through J Bridge except for this. In VolumeShaper4, if I set it to Midi-trigger, it never gets triggered. Through LFO tool, it refuses to get off of beat/bpm sync mode. Any clues. ### Welcome! Hello and welcome to r/raymondscott, the subreddit dedicated to all things Raymond Scott! ### Who is Raymond Scott? Raymond Scott (1909 - 1994) was an American composer, band leader, pianist, record producer, and inventor of electronic instruments. Early on in his career in the 1930s, he formed and played in the Raymond Scott Quintette as a pianist. Here, he attempted to revitalize swing music through tight, busy arrangements that reduced reliance on improvisation. During 
Since every topic seems to be technical support and moaning, just was wondering how everyone else is liking 9.5? I changed from 8 in January and its really awesome, the zones are terrific, I assigned hot keys to open and close them so its made me extra efficient, and I love the bezier curves, the best addition I didnt know I needed, and lately the multiband envelope shaper is blowing my mind, so good for making a synth stab or a drum extra snappy. . There I’m planning to build up my own eurorack synth from a few modules and before i buy all the stuff that i need, i have some questions about it. The first question is: What modules would you recommend to buy (except for CVO, envelope shaper, LFO, reverb and filter). Second question: I‘m an audio technician in the event crew of my school and i have to work a lot with analogue audio wiring and band setups, can i use some of the things i learned there for wiring the modules with the CV cables? Third. I saw the one in the sidebar and it looks like it's pretty outdated. Anyways, here are some of my favourites: EQs: Baxandall Simulation Equalizer / BasiQ - Very nice sounding 3 band EQ; more of a sweetening device rather than freq correction Win, Mac / VST, AU / 32bit, 64bit https://www.kuassa.com/products/basiq/ Code Red Free - 60s classic all tube British console inspired EQ and preamp; Waves Abbey Road REDD console like Win, Mac / VST, AU / 32bit, 64bit http://www.shattered.

Besides the saturation that occurs in the analog world, the sounds also get naturally “compressed” and bumped or reduced in certain frequencies. Hence in order to accurately model analog outboard , we modeled and provide on this plugin , the ability to choose type of saturation, an envelope shaper So in my track, I'm having problems getting the kick (and sub bass) to stand out among all of the synth work and everything else that's going on. I understand that a lot of the "punchiness" lies in some of the higher frequencies. What are some things I can do to REALLY get a fat kick drum that is audible? Right now I've re sampled and re shaped the audio, compressed and EQ'ed accordingly, and made sure it isn't panned. My next steps are to use an envelope shaper to play with the attack 
If you put a transient enhancer on a synth that is playing a melody, the transient gets boosted strongly on the first note or two but then gets a lot weaker for the following notes (presumably because they are playing too fast for the plugin to react properly). How do people get around this? I could bounce out one sample of each note or automate the transient shaper to turn on and off before and after each note i guess. any suggestions. I know people that use transient shapers a lot. I always thought I could get the same results just with compressors or volume envelopes or editing the waveform cycles. But I noticed it's not just a beginner tool. So I am missing something here? Do people use them just because it's faster than setting up a compressor? Or it's not just lazyness? I never really had one to make some comparisons (also because they are generally quite expensive) so I'm here asking if I might need one someday. Hi there - it was suggested to me that I'd create such a topic to help people who are unsure whether C7 would be right for them or not. People outside the fence, on it or still clinging to it. I have used cubase since 1997 - "went pro" around 2008 Like many people I have also tried just about every DAW application under the sun. Cubase is simply the best fit for me personally. The TL;DR of it is - yes, its a good upgrade from 6.5 and it is worth it. But this thread is for specifics 
Often find myself shortening kick samples and such with fades. Just simple things. But I'm wondering if it would change anything if I were to stop using fades and find a volume shaping VST? amp#x200B; thanks. The way I’ve been doing it for years has been a ton of LFO Tools/Volume automation for each track I wanted sidechain on. It gets tedious and is far from ideal. I’ve looked up loads of tutorials with a plethora of different techniques. I want to know, which way works best for you? I’ve seen producers on Ableton create a track with a “ghost kick” of sorts and apply some kind of sidechain to everything routed to it. Is there any way to do this on FL? I don’t use ableton so I don’t actually. Can someone explain a bit about transient shapers? Or maybe drop some links to some info? What do you use 'em on most frequently? Which transient shaper is your favorite. Is there any techniques that you guys use to create an anti-reverb effect for sounds? As in making something that has a lot of tail activity Hey All! I was wondering if anyone else ever has an issue with adding too much modulation to a sound they're creating? I often times find that I'll go a little crazy with the LFOs and envelopes in Massive, and sometimes I end up with garbled up nonesense. What are some tips to keep things clean and simple? I listen to a lot of Zomboy, Excision type stuff (very talented sound designers IMO) and I always try to replicate their stuff and mine usually ends up sounding like nonesense. ALthough. 
I normally use sidechain compression to "duck" certain sounds, ie pads/synths duck kicks/snares. however I'd like to have a bit more control over the shape of the release and attack, so a friend recommended volume shapers. I guess my only (theoretical) issue with a volume shaper is that sidechain compression reacts to the source chain and ducks the target using real audio -- so you know it's not going to miss something. Is it normal practice to use both sidechain compression AND a volume. Not the big gated reverb drum sounds, but the ultra tight ones that you hear in punk and alternative rock of the period. Think Husker Du ( What did they use to get the drums to sound I've heard of a process of called transient shaping, which most producers use. Googled it and came across a variety of transient shapers, one by Native Instruments. Is there any way to work around these by not relying 
I work in fl studio, and every time a particular instrument hit's, i want it to hit loud, then quiet a bit immediately, to simulate how someone would give an instrument more kick in real life, by strumming, or hitting with more force. Does anyone know of anything like this, i already know about automation on the clip level which is extremely tedious, and channel level, but i need it on the smallest level possible which is on one actual instrument/patch, So i can just set it, and it'll suction cup ledges (https://imgur.com/oGerGC0) Pick a shape, any shape and it'll still be .
